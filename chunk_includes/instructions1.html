  <b> Instructions: </b>
  <br>
  <p>
    During this experiment, you will be presented with mini-biographies about <b>fictional cultural figures</b>.
  </p>
    
  <p> 
    Before each new mini-biography, you will see an ellipsis ( ... ). Press the <b>spacebar</b> when you're ready to continue.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You will first be presented with a sentence about the cultural figure (e.g., <i>George Carlon was an American comedian. He died in California.</i>). When you have finished
    reading this first sentence, <b>press the spacebar</b>. 
  </p>
  
  <p>You will then be presented with another sentence in chunks, describing an accomplishment of the same cultural figure. When you have read
    the first chunk (e.g., <i> He </i>) press the <b>spacebar</b> and the next chunk will appear (e.g., <i> recorded </i>) . After you have read this chunk,
    press the <b>spacebar</b> and the next chunk will appear (e.g., <i> several stand-up records</i>), and so on. Please try to read at a natural speed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After this 'chunked' sentence, you will be presented with a &ldquo;rating scale&rdquo; from 1 (definitely wrong) to 7 (perfectly fine). Please rate the naturalness of
    the 'chunked' sentence given the context of the first sentence <b>using the mouse</b>.
  </p>

  
  You will have a practice round to get familiarised with the procedure.
